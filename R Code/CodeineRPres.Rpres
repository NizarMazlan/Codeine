## How do we come to Drug Addiction Project
### Problem statement
The use, misuse, and abuse of substances and drugs among adolescents and youngsters has been found to be on the rise. Because there hasn't been much research done in Malaysia to analyze this issue. 

### Solution
Drug abuse is a complex issue and has been a serious public health problem in Malaysia. As a result, we created this project to spread awareness among Malaysians.
