This would be our groups' assignment for Introduction to Data Science. Our group is called GiGit, dont ask the reason why we chose that, its just what it is.
So besikeli, our project is to create a Drug Addict tracker in Malaysia. We will use Shiny Apps to deploy our program that utilized Shiny Server.
The program will show statistics and hotspots of Drug Addict. This is to show the magnitude of the issue of Drug Addiction in Malaysia.
We hope our program will help everyone understand there are some factors the contribute to drug addiction and realize the role that we, as a Malaysian, need to play.
Ciao #salamGiGit

## Description

This website is created by us to help Malaysians understand fully situation of drug addiction in Malaysia. We hope that everyone have awareness on this issue and take action that drug addiction is avoidable. For those of you who do not know what drug addiction is, drug addiction is a disease that affects a person's brain and behavior that lead to inability to control the use of a legal or illegal drug or medication. Substance such as alcohol, marijuana and nicorine also are considered as drug. When you are addicted, you may continue using the drug despite the harm it causes.
