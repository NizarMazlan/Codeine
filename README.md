# Codeine

This would be our groups' assignment for Introduction to Data Science. Our group is called GiGit, dont ask the reason why we chose that, its just what it is.
So besikeli, our project is to create a Drug Addict tracker in Malaysia. We will use Shiny Apps to deploy our program that utilized Shiny Server.
The program will show statistics and hotspots of Drug Addict. This is to show the magnitude of the issue of Drug Addiction in Malaysia.
We hope our program will help everyone understand there are some factors the contribute to drug addiction and realize the role that we, as a Malaysian, need to play.
